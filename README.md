# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple console-based implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" using Java. The game allows a player to play against the computer with different difficulty levels, and tracks the score throughout the game.

## Features

- Play against the computer with random choices or customizable strategies.
- Display of score after each round.
- Play multiple rounds, and the game ends when a specified number of rounds is reached.
- Simple and intuitive console-based interface.
  
## Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Game Logic**: Rock Paper Scissors game mechanics.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Customizable AI behavior (e.g., random moves, or strategic choices).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BerkBerat/Rock-Paper-Scissors.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Rock-Paper-Scissors
    ```

3. Compile the project:
    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    ```

4. Run the game:
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

## How It Works

- **Gameplay**: Players choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, while the computer also selects a move.
- **AI Difficulty**: The computer’s choices can either be random or based on a predefined strategy to simulate different difficulty levels.
- **Rounds**: The game continues until a set number of rounds are completed, and the player’s score is displayed at the end.
- **Winner**: The winner is determined based on the classic rules of Rock Paper Scissors:
    - Rock beats Scissors
    - Scissors beats Paper
    - Paper beats Rock
